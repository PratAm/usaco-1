* Solutions to the [[http://ace.delos.com/usacogate][USACO Training Gateway]] problems

These solutions are provided "as is". I give no guarantees that they will work as expected.

** Instructions

You can compile all the problems by issuing the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC
make
#+END_SRC

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command, replacing ~<section>~ and ~<problem_id>~ with the section and id of the problem you want to compile (see section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible ids):

#+BEGIN_SRC
make <section>/<problem_id>
#+END_SRC

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to the next one, replacing ~1.3/barn1~ with the section and id of the desired problem:

#+BEGIN_SRC
./1.3/barn1
#+END_SRC

Remember that each problem expects its input in a file with a ~.in~ extension in the directory the binary is executed from and with name equal to the problem id, and outputs its result to a file with a ~.out~ extension and with name equal to the problem id.

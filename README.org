* Solutions to the [[http://ace.delos.com/usacogate][USACO Training Gateway]] problems

These solutions are provided "as is". I give no guarantees that they will work as expected.

** Instructions

You can compile all the problems by issuing the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC
make
#+END_SRC

If you want to compile only a specific problem, issue the following command, replacing ~<problem_id>~ with the id of the problem you want to compile (see section "Problems Solved" for the list of possible ids):

#+BEGIN_SRC
make <problem_id>
#+END_SRC

Running a compiled problem is just a matter of executing a command similar to the next one, replacing ~barn1~ with the id of the desired problem:

#+BEGIN_SRC
./barn1
#+END_SRC

Remember that each problem expects its input in a file with a ~.in~ extension in the same directory as the binary and with name equal to the problem id, and outputs its result to a file with a ~.out~ extension and with name equal to the problem id.

** Problems solved

The following is a possibly innacurate list of the problems solved:
- Barn Repair (~barn1.cpp~)
- Broken Necklace (~beads.cpp~)
- Calf Flac (~calfflac.cpp~)
- Dual Palindromes (~dualpal.cpp~)
- Friday the Thirteenth (~friday.cpp~)
- Greedy Gift Givers (~gift1.cpp~)
- Milking Cows (~milk2.cpp~)
- Mixing Milk (~milk.cpp~)
- Name That Number (~namenum.cpp~)
- Palindromic Squares (~palsquare.cpp~)
- Transformations (~transform.cpp~)
- Your Ride is Here (~ride.cpp~)
